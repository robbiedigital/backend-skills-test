A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Example: Otto.

For this exercise we are asking you to define a function `is_palindrome()` that takes an argument of type string and returns a boolean.

You can use any editor or version of Python you wish but please show your work. Use the examples in `palindromes.txt` in this repo.
